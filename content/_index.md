<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/">Department of Political Science</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My interests within comparative politics sit at the intersection of institutional change, governance, and contentious politics. Broadly, I study the political geography of administrative reform in subnational state institutions and public goods provision and its consequences for collective action.<p>

<p>My dissertation examines how repertoires and grievances scale (or do not) across institutional targets across space and time; theorizing the implications of localized opportunity structures for opposition coalitions. With a focus on North Africa, I combine statistical analysis of original event and administrative data with historical sociology and other qualitative methods grounded in fieldwork and documentary analysis of Arabic- and French-language sources.</p>

<p>My work has been published in <em>Democratization</em> and <em>World Development</em>; and supported by the NSF-APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG), the Institute for Humane Studies, the Project on Middle East Political Science (POMEPS), and the Rapoport Family Foundation.</p> 

<p>In 2024, I was a CASA II fellow at the Center for Arabic Study Abroad in Amman, Jordan. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my M.A. from <a href="https://ccas.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies</a>.</p>
